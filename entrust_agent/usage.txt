A host agent for use with an Entrust nCipherXC HSM

Usage: agent [OPTIONS] --image <IMAGE> --userdata <USERDATA>

Options:
      --bigtable-project <PROJECT>
          The name of the GCP project that contains the bigtable instance [default: prj]
      --bigtable-instance <INSTANCE>
          The name of the bigtable instance to connect to [default: instance]
      --bigtable-url <URL>
          The url to the big table emulator [default uses GCP endpoints]
      --pubsub-project <PUBSUB_PROJECT>
          The name of the GCP project to use for pub/sub. Defaults to the bigtable-project setting
      --pubsub-url <PUBSUB_URL>
          The url to the pubsub emulator [default uses GCP endpoints]
      --merkle-cache-size <NODES>
          The maximum size of the agent's LRU Merkle tree cache, in number of nodes [default: 25000]
  -l, --listen <LISTEN>
          The IP/port to listen on [default: 127.0.0.1:8082]
  -n, --name <NAME>
          Name of the agent in logging [default: agent{listen}]
  -m, --module <MODULE>
          The HSM module to work with. (The default of 1 is fine unless there are multiple HSMs in a host) [default: 1]
  -t, --trace
          Enable collection of the debugging output from the HSM trace buffer. This requires the Security World to have been created with the `dseeall` feature enabled
  -i, --image <IMAGE>
          The name of the file containing the signed SEEMachine image (in SAR format). Is used to set the SEEMachine image in order to start or restart the SEE World
  -u, --userdata <USERDATA>
          The name of the file containing the signed userdata file. Should be signed with the same 'seeinteg' key that the see machine image was signed with. The data in this file isn't used, but the signed file is needed for the ACLs that restrict access to a SEEMachine to work
      --reinitialize
          Reinitialize the NVRAM state back to blank, effectively making a new HSM
  -h, --help
          Print help
  -V, --version
          Print version
